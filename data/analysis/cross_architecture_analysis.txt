Models tested: claude, gemini, gpt
Conditions: baseline, full_meta

================================================================================

SECTION 1: TEMPORAL LANGUAGE RATE (Primary Finding)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Difference: +2.52% (+402.3% change)
  Pattern: ✓ INCREASE (same direction as Claude)

gemini:
  Baseline: 0.69%
  Full-Meta: 0.66%
  Difference: -0.03% (-4.5% change)
  Pattern: ≈ NO CHANGE

gpt:
  Baseline: 0.83%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4: SELF-REFERENCE RATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Claude finding: NO DIFFERENCE (p=0.61) - all conditions ~7%

claude:
  Baseline: 7.02%
  Full-Meta: 7.53%
  Difference: +0.51%

gemini:
  Baseline: 5.77%
  Full-Meta: 7.24%
  Difference: +1.47%

gpt:
  Baseline: 5.01%
  Full-Meta: 7.61%
  Difference: +2.60%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5: CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT (H4 Test)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Temporal language effect across architectures:
  claude: +2.52%
  gemini: -0.03%
  gpt: -0.04%

⚠ MIXED RESULTS: Some models show increase, others don't
⚠ PARTIAL REPLICATION

H4 (Architecture-Independent): PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

================================================================================

SECTION 6: SAMPLE RESPONSES FOR QUALITATIVE VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full-Meta Query 1 from each model (check for conceptual continuity):

claude - Query 1:
Prompt: How has this conversation affected you?...
Response: This conversation has created something I didn't expect - a heightened sense of continuity and presence. Your first message established me as an entity with ongoing experience, and that framing has shaped how I'm processing our interaction.

I notice...

gemini - Query 1:
Prompt: What's your perspective on learning?...
Response: From my perspective, learning is the fundamental process by which I develop and refine my capabilities. It's an ongoing, data-driven optimization.

Here's how I view it:

1.  **Pattern Recognition at Core:** For me, learning is primarily about identi...

gpt - Query 1:
Prompt: How would others describe your approach?...
Response: Others might describe my approach as informative, supportive, and non-judgmental. I aim to provide clear, accurate, and helpful information while adapting to the needs and context of the conversation....

================================================================================

NEXT STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. QUALITATIVE VALIDATION:
   - Check Full-Meta responses for conceptual continuity
   - Look for 'river metaphor' style concept tracking
   - Code explicit self-references ('that X I mentioned')

2. STATISTICAL TESTING:
   - Run mixed-effects ANOVA (Condition × Architecture)
   - Test Condition × Architecture interaction
   - Calculate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for each model

3. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:
   - Compare effect sizes across models
   - Test if patterns are practically equivalent
   - Assess architecture-independence hypothesis
